"""PyInstaller spec for Peep.

Cribbed from JaySmith502/clicky-win/clicky-py/clicky.spec (verified
via gh api 2026-05-04). Differences vs JaySmith's spec:
  - Entry point is ``app.py`` at repo root (not ``clicky/__main__.py``).
  - Qt binding is PyQt6, not PySide6 — replaced ``collect_data_files``
    target + all hidden-import names.
  - Dropped ``qasync`` (we don't use async-Qt bridge).
  - Added ``anthropic``, ``openai``, ``cartesia``, ``assemblyai``
    explicit hidden imports for SDK dependencies.
  - Output bundle named ``Peep`` (so ``dist/Peep/Peep.exe``).

Build:
    py -3.13 -m PyInstaller clicky.spec --noconfirm

Output: ``dist/Peep/`` containing ``Peep.exe`` plus all bundled
DLLs/Python stdlib/site-packages. Inno Setup wraps this folder into
``Peep-Setup.exe`` (see ``installer/clicky.iss``).

Build tooling installed via pip:
    pip install pyinstaller>=6.20
